# Computational Modeling of the Ultimatum Game

Cameron Tice, MPhil under Dr. Karen Ersche at Cambridge University.

Work in progress, but if you'd like you can see the results of the first round of simulations, model fitting, and parameter recovery.

The script implements 6 varients of the Fehr Schmidt model of the Ultimatum game. These include novel additions of contribution consideration in determining accept rates, and a comparison Rescorla Wagner and Bayesian learning methods.
